	<h1 style="text-align: center;color:#4281BC; font-size: 38px; line-height: 49px">Importing Data from CASper to Update the WIP Calendar Application</h1>
	<p>You will export a CASper report, save it in Excel as a .csv file, and then import the file into the WIP Calendar.</p>
	<h3 style="text-align: center;color:#4281BC">What You Will Need</h3>
	<ul>
		<ol>Access to CASper for the Company you want to update.</ol>
		<ol><strong>Admin</strong> access to the WIP Calendar</ol>
		<ol>
		  An Internet Connection
		</ol>
		<ol>
		  FTP Access (optional).  See a Web Team Dept Member for FTP assistance.
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<br/><h1 style="text-align: center;color:#4281BC; font-size: 38px; line-height: 49px">BEFORE YOU PROCEED</h1>
	<p>Make a BACKUP of the file you will be writing to during the update process, using FTP.  The .xml file you will be updating is located in the following remote directory on our web host server:
		calendar/models/.  And the name of each company xml file that you could update are as follows:<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>csc.xml</li>
			<li>boy.xml</li>
			<li>jg.xml</li>
			<li>mar.xml</li>
			<li>out.xml</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	A Backup of each should be FTP downloaded to x:\wwwroot\customsigncenter.com\calendar\models\backups\yesterday\<br/>
	
	<div style="color:#35BF74;font-size: 18px;">
	<p><strong>STEP 1</strong>: After backing up the remote xml files, export a csv file, by logging into CASper and opening the Custom Sign Center company profile.<br/><br/>
		<strong>STEP 2</strong>: Open REPORTS from the main panel, and select WIP Calendar CSV Report.<br/><br/>
		Select the Report type as "WIP", and for the report period, choose dates 1 month before and 2 months after the current date.<br/><br/>
		<strong>STEP 3</strong>: Save the report as a "Comma Delimited Report" .csv, using the File->Save As menu in Excel.  (Save it to your local hard drive).</div><br/><br/>
	<pre>-- Close CASper; Go Online to http://customsigncenter.com/calendar and login with admin credentials.<br/>If you do not see the large "IMPORT CSV" button, you are not logged in as an Administrator.<br/>Speak with Judy, Sam, or Tabitha to see if you can use their credentials --</pre><br/><br/><div style="color:#35BF74;font-size: 18px">
		<strong>STEP 4</strong>: On the csv import utility page, SELECT THE CORRECT COMPANY from the dropdown.  Selecting the incorrect company will import multiple job records into the wrong calendar.  Avoid that!<br/><br/>
		<strong>STEP 5</strong>: Click the Button "Choose Files" to select the .csv file you saved from CASper.<br/><br/>
		<strong>STEP 6</strong>: (Final Step)  Click button "Import CSV to Calendar".  This will (a) upload the selected file to the remote server, and (b) search through the entire Calendar, only adding in csv data for jobs that (1) do not already exist somewhere, or (2) do exist AND are marked "unassigned" AND are on a different date than its corresponding data in the csv.  If there is a date-conflict for unassigned jobs, the calendar's job is deleted, and the CASper update's job is written into the app at the appropriate date.<br/><br/>
		<strong>STEP 7</strong>: (Optional) It is a good idea to now backup the updated version, but do not overwrite "yesterdays" version.  FTP download your changed xml file to x:\wwwroot\customsigncenter.com\calendar\models\backups\</div></p>
		<br/><br/>
		Note: If you try to upload a csv file twice (or a file with the same name), you will be stopped by a warning, and the import app will ask you if you want to delete the remote file and try again.  Click "delete" and upload the file to complete the import.<br/>
		
		<br/>
	<h1 style="text-align: center;color:#4281BC; font-size: 38px; line-height: 49px">What does the Import Do?</h1>
	<p>It will only apply new jobs to the calendar and skip over jobs that already exist in the calendar when the jobs are assigned.<br/>You could run the same csv import several times in a row and it will not make any changes at all after the first import.</p>
	<h2 style="text-align: center;color:#4281BC; font-size: 27px; line-height: 36px">What if Something Goes Wrong?</h2>
	<p>If you refresh or hit the submit button on the calendar you updated and the calendar does not fully load, there is a problem with the updated XML file (e.g., the csc.xml file).  This NEVER OCCURS... except on very rare occasions.  I have only had this occur when the .csv file has a bad field imported from CASper.  For example, if for some reason one of the DUE DATES has the year 2117.  That would probably crash the import script.  This happens because for each year, date and month, the import script has to locate a corresponding node representing each.  If it can only find a year node with a value of "2017", it will probably only do a partial import and stop when it gets to the corrupted csv record.<br/><br/>Fix it by (1) Uploading the backup CSV file from the yesterday folder on x drive to replace the file in the models folder on the remote server.  Open the local csv with excel and examine, particularly, the date column to ensure these are within the date range of the online WIP Calendar.  Fix or delete any malformed records in the csv.  Save and upload the file again using importcsv.</p>
